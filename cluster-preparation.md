## Overview

This guide describes how to prepare a Kubernetes cluster to enable
the deployment of Nextflow pipelines using Nextflow Tower.

## Requirements

To allow Tower to operate with your Kubernetes cluster you will need:

1. The cluster server URL and certificate or the vendor specific credentials.
2. A Kubernetes *namespace* and *service account* that allows the execution of Nextflow pods
3. A [ReadWriteMany](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes)
enabled shared file system used as scratch storage for the pipeline execution.

## Cluster preparation

The following steps describe the operations required to prepare your Kubernetes cluster
in order to enable the deployment of Nextflow pipelines using Tower.

For the sake of this guide, it is assumed the Kubernetes cluster is already configured and
you have administration permissions.


### 0. Verify connection

Make sure you are able to connect your Kubernetes cluster using the command in a shell terminal:

```
kubectl cluster-info
```

### 1. Namespace creation

Even though this is not mandatory, it is generally recommended to create a separate
Kubernetes namespace for your Tower deployment. Use the command below to create a new
Kubernetes namespace:

```
kubectl create ns <YOUR-NAMESPACE>
```        

Replace the string `<YOUR-NAMESPACE>` with a name of your choice.
We will use `tower-nf` for the sake of this guide.

Finally switch to the new workspace using the command below:

```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<YOUR-NAMESPACE>
```

e.g.

```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=tower-nf
```

### 2. Service account & role creation

This step creates a service account and the corresponding role to allow Tower to
operate properly.

Create the required resources and permissions file by copy & pasting the following content in your
terminal:

```yaml
cat > config-rbac.yaml << EOF
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tower-launcher-sa
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: tower-launcher-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods", "pods/status", "pods/log", "pods/exec", "jobs", "jobs/status", "jobs/log"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "delete"]
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: ["deployments"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "delete"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tower-launcher-rolebind
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: tower-launcher-role
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tower-launcher-sa
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tower-launcher-userbind
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: tower-launcher-user
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: tower-launcher-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
...
EOF
```

Then apply the policy to your cluster using this command:

```
kubectl apply -f config-rbac.yaml
```

This creates a service account named `tower-launcher-sa` which will be used by
Tower to operate with the Kubernetes cluster and allow Nextflow to submit
the pipeline jobs.

Use this service account name when setting up the Tower computer environment
for this Kubernetes cluster.

### 3. Storage configuration

This step heavily depends on the storage options available in your infrastructure or
provided by your cloud vendor.

Tower requires the use of a *ReadWriteMany* storage mounted in all computing
nodes where the pods will be dispatched.

Possible supported solutions include NFS servers, GlusterFS, CephFS, Amazon FSx
amongst others. A comprehensive list is available at
[this link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes).

The setup of such storage is beyond the scope of this guide.
Ask your cluster administrator for more details.


### 4. Amazon EKS specific setting

When operating with a Amazon EKS cluster you will need to assign
the service role created in the previous step with an AWS user that will
be used by Tower to access the EKS cluster.

Use the following command to modify the EKS auth configuration:

```
kubectl edit configmap -n kube-system aws-auth
```

Once the editor is open, add the following entry:

```yaml
  mapUsers: |
    - userarn: <AWS USER ARN>
      username: tower-launcher-user
      groups:
        - tower-launcher-role
```

Your user ARN can be found with the following command or using the
 [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam):

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

__NOTE:__ The same user needs to be used when specifying the AWS credentials in the
configuration of the Tower compute environment for EKS.


For more details check the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html).

The AWS user should have the following IAM policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "TowerEks0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "eks:ListClusters",
        "eks:DescribeCluster"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Google GKE specific setting

When configuring a Google GKE cluster you will need to grant the cluster access to the service account
used to authenticate the Tower compute environment. This can be done updating the *role binding*
as shown below:

```yaml
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tower-launcher-userbind
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: <IAM SERVICE ACCOUNT>
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: tower-launcher-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
...
EOF
```

In the above snippet replace the placeholder `<IAM SERVICE ACCOUNT>` with the corresponding service account e.g.
`test-account@test-project-123456.google.com.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

For more details refer to the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/role-based-access-control).
